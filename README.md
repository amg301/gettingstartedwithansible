# Getting Started With Ansible
This project is designed to be a starting point for those that are new to Ansible. This has been created by the Red Hat Energy Pod but will likely be useful for anyone that is new to Ansible. It will include examples and best practices that can easily be adopted or modified, along with recommendations on how to keep your automation version controlled.

## Who is this for?
This is for the brand new user, or the everyday 'git scraper' that has been pulling and running code without having the opportunity to make their own.  We hope that 
this will give anyone the power to understand the basic structure, operations, and best practices for Ansible engine as well as the Ansible Automation Platform.

## What should I know before I start?
Nothing!  Ansible makes the world better by using a human readable language called [YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html).  Chances are if you have played around with ansible playbooks and looked through them you are already reading and ready to code in yaml!
