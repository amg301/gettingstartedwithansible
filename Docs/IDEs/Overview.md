# IDEs
Integrated Development Environment

For Ansible, IDEs can be a very handy tool. While YAML can easily be written in an text editor, or from the CLI, for those that are new to YAML and Ansible may like to use some of the key features offered by most IDEs. Those being syntax checkers and Github integration. These nice extensions can make it much easier to get started and save some time when debugging. WHile YAML is a very simple language there are still some requirements and some specific formatting that MUST be adhered to.

## What IDEs are out there?

## Github Integration
Github integration allows simple management of the fetch, edit, commit, push and merge process directly from the same tool you are writing your roles and playbooks. Ansible Towers integration with Github allows it to easily grab the latest changes or any previous version as needed.
