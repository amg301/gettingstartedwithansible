# Version Control
Managing your automation code takes a little effort but will help you scale easily. In this example we are going to use github to help manage versions, commit changes, and approve requests.

## Quick intro to Git
Git is one of the most common source control mechanisms available today, and Github is a repository hosting service for git controlled information (documents, code, etc...).

## Installing Git
### On Windows

### On Mac
The easiest way to install Git on MacOS is to use Homebrew.

> brew install git
